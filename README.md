Building my own blog site with Django. Starting off by following the Django Girls tutorial here https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/

Now working on https://tutorial-extensions.djangogirls.org/en/

Things I've added outside the tutorial:
-I did all my own CSS/HTML.
-I added a footer and a navigation bar (currently only Home/About work).

Things to do (roughly in order):
-Fix the couple of pylint errors. Not sure why they're there and they don't seem to affect how the site runs but I should at least look into what they mean.
-Improve appearance, maybe add some JS.
-Add custom error pages.
-Add categories to posts.
-Add search to posts.
-Add resources page. This will probably be another Django app. It will be a list of links to sites that teach you programming/web design stuff.
    Each link will have a brief description and a category which will be used in a search function.
-Add contact page. Probably just a form that sends to my email.
-Create a proper home page. Will display posts but have an intro section above. Then there'll be a new navigation link for 'Blog' which goes to the posts.
-Allow people to register and make an account. They'll need an account to post comments.
