This is my blog, finally live here: https://rebeccalowe.herokuapp.com/
I'd give it a domain, but I need a good name first. I'm bad at naming things.

This blog was started by following these tutorials:
https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/
https://tutorial-extensions.djangogirls.org/en/

Things I've added outside the tutorial:
I did all my own CSS/HTML.
I added an 'about' page.
I added a footer and a navigation bar (currently only Home/About work).

Things to do (roughly in order):
Fix the couple of pylint errors. Not sure why they're there and they don't seem to affect how the site runs but I should at least look into what they mean.
Improve appearance, maybe add some JS.
Add custom error pages.
Add categories to posts.
Add search to posts.
Add resources page. This will probably be another Django app. It will be a list of links to sites that teach you programming/web design stuff.
    Each link will have a brief description and a category which will be used in a search function.
Add contact page. Probably just a form that sends to my email.
Create a proper home page. Will display posts but have an intro section above. Then there'll be a new navigation link for 'Blog' which goes to the posts.
Allow people to register and make an account. They'll need an account to post comments. Currently, comments must be approved by me before being shown which is not ideal.
