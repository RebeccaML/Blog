<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I have a wide range of interests. I consider myself a life-long learner and there's always something I'm working on,
    whether it be a programming project, writing a story or learning a new language. Most likely it will be multiple things at a time.
    Here you can find information about the things I enjoy doing (in no particular order).
</p>
<h3>Computer Games</h3>
<p>I've been interested in computer games since I was very young, well before I could adequately play
    them. I remember
    sitting on my dad's lap while he played
    one of the early versions of King's Quest,
    then a few years later watching him play Baldur's Gate and screaming at him when he got rid of
    Imoen.
</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate is still one of my favourite games, despite how old it is now. I like RPGs the most and
    will try almost anything in that genre. I prefer
    games set in the past versus anything space related. I played Everquest for many years, which I got
    into
    because of my dad.
    Before I quit I was the enchanter class lead for my raiding guid. I still miss my guild, but
    unfortunately the game was declining in quality and I had to stop.
    Now the game I play most often is World of Warcraft, where I'm slowly leveling a protection paladin.
</p>
<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I've always loved music. I mostly listen to various forms of heavy metal and rock but I also enjoy
    classical music
    and the odd pop song.
    My favorite bands are Nightwish, Epica and Kamelot and I've seen them all live.
</p>
<p>I took piano and singing lessons for many years and I still enjoy both. I sort of learned guitar at
    school but I'd
    like to go back and get good at it,
    and I'm also interested in learning to play the violin but... who has the time? :(
</p>
<h3>Languages</h3>
<p>I really enjoy learning languages. I learned Italian while I was in school, but I've unfortunately
    lost most of it
    from not studying since.
    I started learning Spanish when I moved to the United States, and I'd say I'm at a basic
    conversational level when
    speaking/listening, but much higher when reading or writing.
    I just find that Spanish speakers speak so quickly that I can't make out what they're saying. I'm
    sure one day I'll
    get it.
</p>
<p>I've also been learning Dutch, though I'm at a much lower level. My grandfather on my mother's side
    was from Holland,
    and he spoke multiple languages. I guess
    I felt that having Dutch blood may make it easier to learn the language, but so far it's like any
    other. Some people
    may say Dutch is not a 'useful'
    language, as most Dutch people speak decent English. I don't care, because I like the way it sounds,
    it's part of my
    heritage, and many of my favorite singers are Dutch.
    So there.
</p>
<p>People think I'm crazy when I tell them all the languages I want to learn before I die so... I just
    won't.</p>
<h3>Programming</h3>
<p>I like programming but that's probably obvious already. Before I begin - yes, I know HTML is not a
    programming
    language. It is a markup language.
    But it's where I started. Back when all the cool kids were on MySpace, I was too (even though I
    wasn't really cool).
    I was also on VampireFreaks. Both those
    sites let you customise your profile page using HTML and CSS, though I think VampireFreaks was more
    flexible. I used to
    change my theme every few weeks or so.
    Some of my background/text combinations now that I think about it. I also liked having marquees
    everywhere.
</p>
<p>After high school I took some web development courses and received a Diploma in Website Devlopment. I
    learned HTML,
    CSS, PHP and MySQL. We only ever touched on JavaScript. I guess those were simpler times.
    I was decent at PHP and MySQL at the time and always meant to go back and improve but then I started university
    and didn't really have the time. Now apparently PHP is not so popular anymore anyway.
</p>
<p>I then completed my IT degree at the University of Technology in Sydney, where I learned Java, C++ and C#. Java is the only one I've really
    stuck with since
    graduation, though perhaps I'll revisit the others
    at some point.
</p>
<p>Since graduating I have taught myself the new features in HTML5 and CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript and
    Python. I've been
    learning to make full stack web applications using
    the MERN stack. I really prefer backend as I'm not particularly artistic. Python is my favourite
    programming
    language, replacing Java, though
    I still think I'd like to work on my Java skills some time soon.
</p>
<p>I'm going to tell you a secret now - I hate JavaScript with a passion. The syntax is horrible. ES6 is
    even worse.
    Does it make things shorter? Sure.
    But it's not very easy to read. I don't deny that it's a useful language, but it's ugly and I hate
    working with it.
</p>
<p>I have a few game ideas. I think I'll write them in Python despite some people saying it's not ideal
    for games. My
    starting ones will likely just be text-based anyway.
    My first will probably be a Roguelike game since I recently found a tutorial for making one.
</p>
<h3>Baking</h3>
<p>I really like cooking and baking but particularly the latter. I mostly bake bread. Freshly baked
    bread is one of the
    best things in the world.
    I'm planning on making my own starter soon and baking sourdough, though my husband says he doesn't
    like it and if he
    doesn't like even <em>my</em>
    sourdough then we will have a problem!
</p>
<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>I love to write. I mostly write fantasy/adventure type stories. I have upwards of 30 partially
    written stories. A few
    I think have potential, if I could
    just get them finished! I have participated in NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) for the last
    few years, and
    reached my 50k word count target each time.
    That is what lead me to being so very close to finishing one particular story. I just have to finish
    the final
    version as, especially when I'm pressured to write quickly,
    there are often parts that have to be completely rewritten.
</p>
<p>I'm planning on turning some of my story ideas into games. I want to make a massive RPG as I think I
    could create a
    more compelling story than most that are out there.</p>
